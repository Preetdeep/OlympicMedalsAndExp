Impact of Experience and Age on Success in Olympics
Using a dataset of over 120 years of Olympic history, I find that after 1950 the mean age of medal winners is higher than that of non-medal winners. This relationship is more pronounced in the case of Gold medalists. I hypothesise that Age is a proxy for experience of Olympic Games and show that the probability of getting a medal in the second appearance is higher than that in the first one. This could be due to experience, better handling of pressure and better preparation.
